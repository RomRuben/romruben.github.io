**An Application of Fuzzy Prototypes to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Fuzzy Diseases** 
<br>

Decision support systems, embedded in modern telemedicine applications, are a tool to improve the skills of general practitioners and patients in decision-making in medicine. Nowadays, one of the more challenging problems in this context is how to diagnose those diseases, whose early clinical signs are often subtle, and many of their common signs and symptoms are similar to other. These “fuzzy diseases,” even they can have distinctive features, are not diagnosable through a concrete clinical test or symptom, and, thus, they are difficult to recognize, especially in their initial phases when they might be mistaken for other similar ones. Then, the diagnosis of a fuzzy disease set is based on the exclusion of symptoms and tests results, due to the similarity between them. In the present article, it is proposed the development of a Clinical Decision Support System framework to diagnose a set of fuzzy diseases, concretely applied to Fibromyalgia and associated syndromes. For this purpose, in this paper a reasoning method that uses theories about conceptual categorization from the psychology, pattern recognition, and Zadeh's prototypes has been designed. Through the use of this model, satisfactory results in the evaluation of patients were obtained.

**A comparative study of Soft Computing software for enhancing the capabilities of business document management systems**

There are several types of business documents, ranging from brief accounting
documents to complex legal agreements. Companies extensively use such documents
to communicate, transact business and analyse their productivity. This results
in the generation of a large number of documents daily, and small- and
medium-sized enterprises are easily overwhelmed by this situation. Given this
background, companies require software solutions which provide all of the
features required by users for optimal document management, as well as
optimising management processes and automating the extraction of relevant
information from the documents. Open-source software provides these
organizations with low-cost, high-quality software which incorporates an array
of advanced features that extend beyond only storage solutions.

In this study, we test several computational-intelligence open-source software
tools in order to enhance the information-retrieval capabilities in small
business document-management systems. We implement a prototype to test these
natural language-processing tools and machine-learning techniques in a business
environment, with the aim of choosing the best alternative for each process.

**Clinical Decision Support System for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Fuzzy Diseases** 
<br>

_Conference: Conference of the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAEPIA)_

The application of smart programs and services in the medical field is nowadays a reality that guarantees patients a quality healthcare. In the present article, it is proposed the development of a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in order to diagnose a set of “fuzzy diseases”.This concept refers to the diseases that are not diagnosable through a concrete clinical test or symptom. Then, the diagnosis of a “fuzzy diseases” set is based in the exclusion of symptoms and tests results, due to the similarity between them. For dealing with these inconveniences, in this paper it has been designed a reasoning method which uses mainly a theory about the conceptual categorization from the Psychology field and the prototypes concept of Zadeh. Through the use of this model, it was obtained a satisfactory result in the evaluation of patients.
